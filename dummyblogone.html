            <h2>What is machine learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Machine learning (ML) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
            </p>

            <h2>Why is machine learning important?</h2>
            <p>
                Machine learning is important for companies to get an overview of customer behavior trends and operational patterns and to support new product development. Many of today's major companies, including Naukri, TickTock, and Facebook, have made machine learning at the core of their operations. Machine learning has become a key competitive differentiator for many companies.
            </p>
            <h2>Types of machine learning</h2>
            <p>
                There are four basic approaches: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> In this type of machine learning, a data scientist provides labeled training data to an algorithm and defines variables for which the algorithm evaluates correlations. Both the input and output of the algorithm are specified.
            </p>
            <p>
                <Strong>Unsupervised Learning:</Strong> This type of machine learning involves algorithms that train on unlabeled data. This algorithm scans the data set looking for meaningful connections. The data the algorithm trains on and the predictions or recommendations it makes are predetermined
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Semi-supervised learning:</strong> This machine learning approach is a mixture of the previous two types. A data scientist can primarily feed training data to an algorithm, but a model can examine the data itself to develop its own understanding of the dataset. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Reinforcement learning:</strong> There are well-defined rules. Data scientists program algorithms to complete tasks and give positive or negative cues as they figure out how to perform tasks. But most of the time the algorithm itself decides which steps to take along the way
            </p>
            <h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of machine learning?</h2>
            <p> 
                Machine learning has seen a variety of use cases, from predicting customer behavior to developing operating systems for self-driving cars.
                When it comes to profits, machine learning can help businesses understand their customers on a deeper level. By collecting customer data and correlating it with behavior over time, machine learning algorithms learn the associations and enable teams to align product development and marketing initiatives with customer demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some companies are using machine learning as a key driver of their business model. For example, Uber uses algorithms to match drivers with passengers. Google uses machine learning to show ride-hailing ads in search.
                But machine learning also has its drawbacks. Best of all, it can be expensive. Machine learning projects are typically driven by highly paid data scientists. These projects also require expensive software infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also the problem of machine learning bias. Algorithms trained on datasets that exclude certain populations or contain errors can fail at best and lead to inaccurate models in a discriminatory world at worst. When a company builds its core business processes on a biased model, it can lead to regulatory and reputational damage.
