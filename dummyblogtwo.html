            <h2>What is deep learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Deep learning is a term often used interchangeably with machine learning. However, they are not the same. Machine learning is a form of artificial intelligence in which computers learn without being told to do something. DL, on the other hand, is the process by which a machine learns to do something using an artificial neural network consisting of many layers organized hierarchically.

            <h2>Types of deep learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Deep learning is mainly divided into  Artificial Neural network (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Lets have a brief overview of these two types.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Artificial Neural Network (ANN):</strong> Artificial Neural community (ANN) is a studies hotspot inside the subject of artificial intelligence since the 20 century 80 era. It abstracts the human mind neuron network from the perspective of records processing, establishes a easy model, and forms specific networks in line with exclusive connection methods.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):</strong> A Convolutional Neural community is a category of synthetic neural network that makes use of convolutional layers to filter out inputs for useful facts. The convolution operation entails combining input facts (characteristic map) with a convolution kernel (filter out) to shape a transformed characteristic map. The filters in the convolutional layers (conv layers) are modified based on found out parameters to extract the most beneficial data for a particular task.

            <p> 
                Convolutional networks alter routinely to find the first-class function primarily based at the mission. The CNN could clear out statistics about the form of an item whilst confronted with a preferred object reputation venture however could extract the colour of the hen whilst faced with a bird recognition undertaking. this is based totally on the CNNâ€™s information that exceptional classes of gadgets have exclusive shapes however that unique types of birds are more likely to vary in shade than in form.
